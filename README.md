# AI-Based Municipal Complaint Classification and Urgency Detection System

This project uses AI to classify free-text municipal complaints (e.g., roads, garbage, water) and detect urgency levels using sentiment analysis and rule-based classification. Built with HuggingFace Transformers, Gradio, and Pandas, it enables real-time smart triaging of complaints to improve civic governance efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts free-text complaint input via Gradio UI
- Identifies complaint category using custom keyword mapping
- Detects urgency level using sentiment + emergency keyword rules
- Logs complaints in a structured table for review or analysis

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Gradio (UI)
- Pandas (logging)
- Google Colab

## 🌍 Status
This is a working prototype with scope for integration into real municipal systems.
